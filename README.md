# Mantle_Convection_Lab
This is a 2D mantle convection code, written in C with finite element method, parallel computing, and adaptive mesh. This code is written by Mingming Li at Arizona State University.
This is just the first version. There remains a lot to be added to this code. The goal for this code is to deal with multi-scale dynamics and complex rheology more effectively. The code is self-consistent and does not rely on any other software.
